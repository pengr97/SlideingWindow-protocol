# SlidingWindow-protocol
There are three hosts which are host A, host B and agent. Host A is a sending terminal, host B is the receive terminal, and the agent is used to simulate various phenomena in the network transmission. 
IP protocol is TCP, therefore, host B must start first, agent is the following and host A is the last one.


#agent

0: normal transmission

1: simulate packed loss

2: simulate date wrong

3: simulate delay
